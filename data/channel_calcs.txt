The robot number is the number written on the actual XBee's, and the
one stored in the "Node Identifier" address.

The minimum channel is 0x0B, and the max is 0x1A.  This means that we
can run at least fifteen robots with each having a separate channel

The PAN ID is between 0x0000 and 0xFFFF, but we don't want to use
0xFFFF because it sends to all PAN ID's
